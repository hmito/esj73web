## Qualifications for entry and registration fee

### Can non-members participate or give a presentation?

Upon paying the registration fee, non-members can join the audience. Non-members can be co-authors of presentations. 

About the presentation, except for invited speakers to the Symposia or the Forum, non-members cannot be either organizers or speakers. Please confirm the qualifications for entry for other roles (e.g., presenter or organizer) in the [Eligibility for Registration](registinfo_en#presentation-eligibility-by-membership-type).

### Are the workshop presenters required to apply for entry and pay the registration fee?

#Registration-for-participation).

### Are audience members who only attend the workshops required to apply for entry and pay the registration fee?

Participants who attend only the workshops are also required to register for the conference and pay the registration fee. Since in ESJ72 online contents seems to be extremely limited, [the workshop-only-participation fee is no longer offered](registinfo_en#abolition-of-quota-for-participation-in-workshops-only).

## About the hybrid format
<!-- ハイブリッド絡みのQ&Aですが、オンライン主体の去年とオンサイト主体の今年とでは文言を変える必要がある箇所が多数あるように思います。今年のオンライン対応のページを参照しながら書き換えた (またはいらないと思って削除した)つもりですが、過不足がないかチェックをお願いします (英語版も同様)。 池川 -->

### The speaker of the meeting which was scheduled to participate on-site suddenly asked for a remote presentation. Is it possible to change it?

Online presentations at the various meetings will not be permitted. This is to avoid any trouble in advance, since it is necessary to present using a presentation PC set up at the venue and there are restrictions on channel capacity at the venue.

### Is it possible to make an oral presentation at online?

Oral presentations are on-site only. They will not be available at online and on-demand streaming.

### I am invited to a symposium or workshop. Can I give my presentation via pre-recorded video with the consent of the organizer(s)?

Pre-recorded video presentations are not permitted for symposia or workshops with abstract submission. They are permitted only for forum presentations and presentations that do not involve abstract submission, such as explanations of purpose, comments, and statements of opinion.

### Is it possible to make only some of the presentations of a workshop/symposium private on-demand?

It is possible. Even if you have requested on-demand streaming of the entire meeting when submitting the proposal, you can set whether or not individual presentations can be streamed on-demand at the time of abstract submission.

## Abstracts

### Will abstracts be peer-reviewed?

Abstracts will not be peer-reviewed. Abstracts will be published as they are registered in the application system.

### I was not able to register my abstract by the deadline. Will my presentation be canceled?

No, you can give your presentation even if you miss the abstract submission deadline. However, your abstract will be left blank.

### Do forum speakers need to register their abstracts?

No, it is not necessary. For the forum, the organizer will register the abstract.
