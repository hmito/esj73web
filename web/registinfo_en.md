# Registrations and Proposals

We are currently accepting applications for open sessions and the ER Symposium. For details, please visit the following pages:

- [Open Sessions](opensession_en)
- [ER Symposium](ersympo_en)

Applications for General Presentations, Symposia, Workshops, and Junior Posters are scheduled to open around October.

## Revision of Overlap Restriction Rules

The Ecological Society of Japan aims to create rules for participation in conventions that are easy for everyone to understand. At the 73rd conference, we have decided to revise the complicated rules of overlap restriction for presentations, and to make <span style="color: red; ">“one-person, one-presentation”</span> as the general rule. Regardless of the presentation format (symposium, workshop, regular presentations (oral and poster), etc.), each participant is allowed to give only one presentation. <span style="color: red; ">**Please note that the overlap of presentations in workshop and regular presentations, which was allowed until the previous conference, will NOT be permitted in the current conference**</span>. The following cases, however, are exceptions.

- Organizers of symposium/workshop who do not present with abstract submission at the focal session can be speakers for regular presentations. In addition, the overlap restrictions do not apply to explanations of purpose, commentators, and expressions of opinion that do not involve abstract submission.
  - However, since symposia and oral sessions of regular presentations can be held concurrently, **it is not recommended that organizers of the symposium who do not present with abstract submissions be speakers for the oral session**.
  - Please note that if these organizations/presentations without abstract submissions conflict with your own time of presentations with abstract submission, **the speakers are responsible for making their own schedules for organizations/presentations without abstract submissions**.
- Since the forum is an event of the various committees of the ESJ, its organizers and topic providers are not subject to the overlap restrictions.

||Symposium|Workshop|Regular Presentation|Forum|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Symposium|×|×|×|〇|
|Workshop|×|×|×|〇|
|Regular Presentation|×|×|×|〇|
|Forum|〇|〇|〇|〇|

If you are already a speaker with abstract submission of the respective category, you cannot become a speaker with abstract submission of the category marked with an "×".
