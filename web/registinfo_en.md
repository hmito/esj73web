## Restrictions on Multiple Presentations

The Ecological Society of Japan aims to create rules for participation in conventions that are easy for everyone to understand. At the 73rd conference, we have decided to revise the complicated rules of overlap restriction for presentations, and to make <span style="color: red; ">“one-person, one-presentation”</span> as the general rule.

- Regardless of the presentation format—such as symposium, workshop, oral, or poster presentation—from this conference onward, **each participant is allowed to give only one presentation with abstract (\*)**.
  - Please note that, unlike previous conferences, <span style="color:red;">it is NOT permitted to be a presenter in both a workshop and a regular presentation at this conference</span>.
  - Pdresentations given in forums, which are events organized by various committees, are not subject to this restriction.
- In addition to the above presentations with abstract, it is possible to give contributions that do not require the submission of a presentation abstract (\*), such as purpose explanations, commentators, panelists, or lightning talks, or to organize a session only.
  - Please note that symposia and oral presentations may be scheduled in the same time slot. Even if presentation times overlap, <span style="color:red;">no adjustments will be made to the presentation schedule</span>. We kindly ask for your understanding that we will not be able to accommodate individual requests.
  - For workshops, considering their diverse formats, they are scheduled so as not to overlap with symposia and oral presentations.
- Each participant may organize only one session, except for forums. It is not permitted to register as an organizer for multiple sessions.

\* The basis for this restriction is the "presentation abstract" registered by each presenter. If the organizer of a session does not register as a "presentation" at the time of application and only provides information in the "session abstract," such presentations are not subject to the above restriction.

## Presentation Eligibility by Membership Type

Only ESJ members (regular, student and emeritus members) are eligible to be presenters (primary author) at the conference. Non-members are eligible to present in the following three cases:
