Non-members are not eligible to present with [some exceptions](#presentation-eligibility-by-membership-type). Non-members who do not fall under any of the exceptions must **apply for membership in the Ecological Society of Japan prior to submitting registration and proposal**. The admission procedure may take some time, so please complete the procedure well in advance.

**[[Go to the ESJ membership application site]](https://www.esj.ne.jp/esj/English/join.html)**

1. Please follow the above link to complete the new membership application.
2. Upon confirmation of your application for membership, the Member Service Desk will notify you of your temporary membership number.
3. Please use your temporary membership number to register for the conference and presentation.

## Other Notes

### If you have not paid the membership fee from 2023, you will not be able to complete any procedures.

If you have not paid the membership fee from 2023, you will not be able to apply to speak at the 2025 conference until we can confirm payment of your 2023 membership fee. As you will not be able to submit your presentation until your payment is confirmed and your status is updated, please pay the membership fee, at least, one week before the deadline.

To check the status of your membership fee payment, please visit [My Page](https://iap-jp.org/esj/mypage/login/login).

### Abolition of Quota for Participation in Workshops Only

In the past, the ESJ conference has included a “Workshop Only Attendance” category in the registration process. However, taking into account the fact that the Workshop requires significant operating expenses and that only a few people have applied for this category in the past few years, the Board of Directors has decided to abolish the “Workshop Only Attendance” category for the ESJ72. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we ask that those who wish to attend only Workshops also follow the regular procedures to participate in the conference.

### Participation Certificates/Receipts

Participation certificates and receipts will be issued from the conference platform ONLINE CONF, not from the application site. Please note that printed copies will not be sent out and will be available for downloading after 6th Jan. 2025, when ONLINE CONF will be opened. Please note that the amount shown on the receipt is non-taxable for members (both regular and student) and taxable for non-members.　The participation fee covers the cost of attending the research presentations and meetings. Lunch and receptions are not included.

The Ecological Society of Japan is **not registered** as a Qualified Invoicing Business and cannot issue invoices.

If you wish to pay the registration fee publicly (e.g., by invoice payment), please apply for registration first. Next, please select “Postal Transfer” as the payment method, complete the application, and then contact us via the inquiry page. We ask that payment be made in advance.

### Abolition of Errata

The conference does not accept revisions based on errata after the presentation application or proposal has been submitted. Please make sure that there are no errors in the content when submitting your abstract. Students who have little experience in participating in academic meetings are especially encouraged to discuss the title and presenter information thoroughly with their academic advisors before submitting their abstracts.

### Cancellation Policy

If a cancellation request is received before the refund deadline for each event (21st Feb. 2025 for this year's event), a refund will be made, excluding bank transfer fees and other expenses. In principle, no refunds will be made after the refund deadline has passed.

### Handling of research achievements when presentations cannot be given at ESJ72

Speakers who have registered their abstracts and paid the registration fee by the deadline will have their presentation information and abstracts recognized as achievements by the society on the web page where the abstracts are published, even if they were unable to present their presentations due to the following reasons.

- Cancellation of the conference due to fire, earthquake, weather, man-made disasters, infectious diseases, etc.
- Failure of conference platform or major network fault 

However, if the registration fee is not paid by the deadline, the presentation information and abstract will be removed from the web page where the abstracts are published, and the research concerned will not be recognized as an achievement, even if it is listed in the program.
