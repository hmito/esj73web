## Restrictions on Multiple Presentations

The Ecological Society of Japan aims to create rules for participation in conventions that are easy for everyone to understand. At the 73rd conference, we have decided to revise the complicated rules of overlap restriction for presentations, and to make <span style="color: red; ">“one-person, one-presentation”</span> as the general rule.

- Regardless of the presentation format (symposium, workshop, oral and poster presentations), each participant is allowed to give only one presentation. 
- <span style="color: red; ">**Please note that being a speaker at workshop and regular presentations, which was possible until the previous conference, will NOT be allowed in the current conference**</span>.
  - Since the forum is an event of the various committees of the ESJ, its organizers and topic providers are not subject to the overlap restrictions.
- The above restriction was **applied to the presentations with abstract submission**. This does not preclude the presentations without abstract submission, such as explanations of purpose, comments, statements of opinion, lightning talks, etc., in addition to the presentations with abstract submission.
  - However, symposia and oral presentations may be held concurrently. Even if the presentation times overlap, **the presentation slots will not be adjusted**. Please note that we will not be able to respond to any inquiries.
  - Since there will be a variety of presentation forms for workshop, it will be allocated at the time that does not overlap with the symposium and oral presentations.
  - Please note that as in the past, each participant is limited to organizing one session.

## Presentation Eligibility by Membership Type
