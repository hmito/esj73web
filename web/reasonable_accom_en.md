# Reasonable Accommodation at the Meeting

The Ecological Society of Japan is committed to fostering diversity and supporting the participation of researchers from all backgrounds, as outlined in our [ESJ Diversity Statement](https://www.esj.ne.jp/esj/e_index.html#diversity). We strive to create an inclusive environment where everyone can participate comfortably.

If you need reasonable accommodation for presentations or attendance due to health conditions or other circumstances, please contact us using the form below. We will carefully consider how we can best support your needs.

- Your inquiry will be shared only with the Chair and Vice-Chair of the Organizing/Program Committee. Personal information will be strictly managed. It will be used solely for organizing the meeting and will not be used for any other purpose.
- We will make every effort to accommodate your request; however, please understand that some requests may not be possible due to venue facilities or operational constraints.
- Please contact us as early as possible. Last-minute requests may be difficult to fulfill, and early consultation allows us to explore more options.
