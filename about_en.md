## Meeting Format

- The meeting will be held in a hybrid format, primarily onsite, with the use of an online platform.
- Oral presentations and sessions will take place onsite. In principle, online-only presentations will not be accepted.
- Poster presentations will be conducted by uploading files in advance to the online platform, allowing participants to freely view them during the meeting period.
    - Participants who wish may also display their posters onsite. Core time will be scheduled for onsite participants.
- For major conference events including some sessions, recordings will be made by the meeting organizers and later made available on the online platform as on-demand streaming. Live streaming is not planned.
    - For other sessions and presentations not covered above, presenters are broadly encouraged to use a "self on-demand" format, in which they record their own presentations and upload the videos to the online platform.

Further details will be posted on this website as they are finalized.
## Schedule

The detailed timetable will be released around the end of December or beginning of January. Please note that the schedule is not final and may be subject to change in the future due to organizational reasons.
