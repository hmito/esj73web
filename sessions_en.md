## Open Session

The following three themes were selected for this year's [Open Sessions](/opensession_en) (symposium that involve the addition of new presentation categories).

### [Wildlife Trade]

[Convener]  
Saeko Terada (Osaka Metropolitan University), Hubert Cheung (Ritsumeikan Asia Pacific University)

[Objectives]  
Overexploitation of wildlife is a major driver of global biodiversity loss, with illegal and unsustainable wildlife trade threatening the survival of species across the Tree of Life. To ensure sustainable wildlife use, effective governance of wildlife trade is necessary. This includes establishing trade regulations on the basis of science and ensuring their effectiveness. However, the uncertainty inherent in population assessments and status of many species, the complexity of wildlife trade chains, the diverse sociocultural drivers of trade, and the telecoupled impacts of trade across the globe make policy-making and enforcement regarding wildlife trade a particularly challenging.  
In order to overcome these challenges, strengthening collaboration across traditional disciplinary lines and building cross-cultural understanding are critical. This proposed Open Session on Wildlife Trade aims to attract wildlife trade experts from Japan and around the world to ESJ73 by providing a forum for interdisciplinary discussion. This will advance the scientific discourse on domestic Japanese and international wildlife trade policy, strengthen international collaboration, and contribute to the development of lasting and sustainable solutions.  
Together, our speakers will introduce the development of wildlife trade regulations and related research, discuss the advancement of an adaptive approach to wildlife trade governance in the 21st century, outline novel and practical ways to better include diverse stakeholders to ensure the effectiveness of conservation measures, and draw lessons from the broader global environmental governance arena to improve wildlife trade management.

[Objectives]  
This session re-examines the “current state of human–nature relationships” from multiple perspectives in contemporary society. In recent years, how people value, live with, and relate to nature has been significantly reshaped by climate change, pandemics, and demographic shifts. For advancing sustainable resource use and effective conservation, to move beyond treating nature solely as something to be protected apart from humans is crucial, and instead ask how we engage with it and can make use of it responsibly.  
The human dimension lies at the heart of this concept. This interdisciplinary field explores the interactions between social systems, that is, human behavior, values, and institutions, and biological systems. This encompasses diverse themes such as the impacts of human activity on biodiversity, social contexts of conservation, public participation, and ethical and policy challenges of environmental management.
Through this open session, we aim to share a wide range of practices and research, including community initiatives that utilize forest resources, citizen science, environmental education, and cultural engagement. By doing so, we will critically revisit the plurality of ways in which people perceive and value nature, and explore new challenges and applications for ecology. The ultimate goal of this session is to provide a platform for interdisciplinary exchange and to reconsider human–nature relationships as we seek new roles for ecology in building a sustainable society.
