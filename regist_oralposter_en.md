# Regular Presentations

Regular presentations include oral and poster sessions.

**Oral session**

- The total presentation time is 15 minutes: 12 minutes for presentation and 3 minutes for Q&A. 
- Presentations are onsite only. Online presentations are not available.
- All presentations must be made using [the PCs provided at the venue](presentation_en#notice). You are not allowed to present using your own PC.
- Oral sessions consist of sessions in both Japanese and English. Oral presentations can be given in English during Japanese oral sessions.
- Since the purpose of establishing the award to promote English presentations has been achieved, the [English Presentation Award will be discontinued at ESJ73](/registinfo_en#notice-on-the-discontinuation-of-the-english-presentation-award). At ESJ73, presenters in the English session will receive a small gift, so we look forward to your continued active participation.

**Poster session**

- There are two opportunities to present posters: online presentations (for all participants) using the conference platform, and on-site presentations (for applicants) at the conference venue.
- Although there will be no core time for online poster presentations, there will be a viewing period for all online posters before the conference starts (scheduled from 8th to 10th Mar. 2025).
- There will be a core time during the conference period for on-site poster presentations. 
- Student members who have not yet obtained a doctoral degree are eligible to apply for [the Poster Award](#poster-award). However, this does not apply to those who have received the Poster Award at a previous ESJ meeting.

## Application for Regular Presentations

### Application Process

## Poster Award
 
To encourage researchers in the early stages of their careers, poster awards will be given for outstanding poster presentations. 

### Eligibility

Student members who have not obtained a Ph.D. (as of the  deadline for regular presentations) are eligible to apply. Please select "Apply for Poster Award" when you apply for a presentation.

- However, those who have received the “Best Award” or “Excellence Award” for the Poster Prize at any past Annual Meeting of the Ecological Society of Japan (including joint meetings with other societies such as EAFES) are not eligible to apply, even if they meet the above requirements. 
- Speakers who requested “Wildlife Trade”, "Extended Phenotype", and "Human Dimensions" in the [Open session](sessions#open-session) as their presentation field are also not eligible to apply for the Poster Award.

### Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation criteria will focus on **ability to convey information** and **quality of research** of the poster.

- **Ability to convey information**: The clarity of the research content will be evaluated. It is important that the text and figures are easy to read, that there is not too much information, and that the essential points can be understood without explanation. For example, the following efforts are required.
    1. Good title
    2. Clear abstract
    3. Eye-catching devise
    4. Effective design that allows for understanding the basic content quickly
- **Quality of research**: Main points of evaluation are as follows.
    1. Novelty and originality
    2. Quality and quantity of data
    3. Appropriateness of analysis methods
    4. Validity of discussion and conclusions

Poster award will be judged based on online posters.

- As part of our efforts to promote internationalization at academic conferences, we will award additional points for research conducted from an international perspective or showing potential for such development. Depending on the research field, however, this will not be considered a mandatory evaluation criterion.
- Only the poster itself will be evaluated; graphical abstracts and explanatory videos will generally not be considered.
    - However, judges may refer to graphical abstracts and explanatory videos to understand the research content.
- For items that are difficult to evaluate based on the poster alone, judges may ask questions to the presenter via text chat and evaluate based on their responses.
- The language used does not directly affect the evaluation, but in the event of a tie, **posters that can be understood in English** will be given higher priority. This applies in the following cases.
    - English is included in the title, introduction, and conclusion.
    - Understanding the outline of research by reading English alone.
    - An English version of the poster is available on a separate page.

### Precautions

- The judging will take place before the conference begins, so please make sure to upload your poster to ONLINE CONF by the specified deadline (scheduled for March 7, 2026, 23:59 (JST)).
- The format for the poster should be **one A0-size sheet**. Either portrait or landscape orientation is acceptable. This is based on the idea that “poster presentation is a a way to summarize research content in a limited space.”
- To ensure fairness, please refrain from including topics on your poster that differ from those you registered.
- There will be no core time or discussion forum for online poster presentations at this conference, so please make sure your posters are easy to understand.


## Awards for Online Poster Presentations

To promote communication among participants through the use of the comment function in the poster presentations at this conference, we have established a “Like!” Award and a Best Discusser Award, which will be selected by all conference participants. The winners of the awards will be announced on the ONLINE CONF and conference website as soon as they are determined.

Please note that these awards are not official awards of the Ecological Society of Japan, but are awarded independently by ESJ73.

### "Like!" Award

- To encourage communication among participants through the comment function, we are introducing a "Like!" Award in addition to the regular poster awards. All posters will be considered for the "Like!" Award. 
- Selection will be based on the number of "Like!" received for the poster presentations, which will be tallied at the end of the conference. All conference participants, including high school students, are eligible to vote "Like!".


### Best Discusser Award

- An award will be presented to an individual conference participant who has contributed to the excitement of all poster presentations, including high school student posters, by posting high quality comments.
- The number of “Like!” on comments will be tallied for each contest participant and used for selection, with the final count taken at the end of the conference. All contest participants, including high school students, have the right to “Like!” comments.
