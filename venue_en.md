## Accommodation

There are limited accommodation options near Kyoto University and the Kyoto International Conference Center. We recommend staying in central Kyoto, especially along the **Karasuma Subway Line** or near **JR Kyoto Station**, for convenient access to both venues.

As Kyoto is a popular tourist destination, **we strongly recommend securing your accommodation as early as possible**. If you book at the last minute, only expensive options may remain available.
