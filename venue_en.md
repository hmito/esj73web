### 11th–13th: Access to Kyoto University, Yoshida South Campus

City buses departing from Shijo Street and Kyoto Station are often extremely crowded and may take longer. The recommended routes are listed below. All options accept <a href="https://www.japan.travel/en/plan/ic-card/" target="_blank">pre-paid IC Travel Card</a> (e.g., Suica, ICOCA, PiTaPa).

#### 1. Karasuma Subway Line + City Bus

The area along the Karasuma Subway Line, which runs north-south from Kyoto Station, offers convenient access to both venues and is highly recommended. The most convenient route is to take the Karasuma Subway Line to Imadegawa Station and transfer to a city bus.

- Take the Karasuma Subway Line and get off at "Imadegawa Station."
    - From Kyoto Station or the Shijo area, take the train bound for "Kokusaikaikan."
- Exit from the south ticket gate via Exit 3, and walk 30 meters to the eastbound "Karasuma Imadegawa" bus stop.
- Use one of the following buses, each operating approximately every 10 minutes:
    - City Bus Route 201 bound for "Hyakumanben/Gion": Get off at "Kyodai Seimon-mae," then walk about 5 minutes.
    - City Bus Route 203 bound for "Ginkakuji/Kinrin-shako": Get off at "Hyakumanben," then walk about 10 minutes.

#### 2. Keihan Railway

From the Kamogawa area and Fushimi area, Keihan Railway is convenient.

- Take the Keihan Main Line bound for "Demachiyanagi" and get off at "Demachiyanagi Station."
- Exit from Exit 7 and walk about 15 minutes.

#### 3. Hoop Bus

From Kyoto Station, <a href="https://hoopbus.jp" target="_blank">Hoop Bus</a> connecting Kyoto Station Hachijo-guchi and Kyoto University Yoshida campus is a convenient and less crowded option.

- Board the Hoop Bus and ride for approximately 30 minutes. Get off at "Kyoto University-mae," then walk about 5 minutes.
    - The boarding location at Kyoto Station is the <a href="https://hoopbus.jp/place/" target="_blank">Hachijo Exit</a> on the south side.
    - Buses run every 15 minutes in the morning and every 30 minutes during the day.
    - One-way circular route; take care when boarding from locations other than Kyoto Station or Kawaramachi Oike.

#### 4. Tozai Subway Line + City Bus

From Nijo and Yamashina areas, the Tozai Subway Line is the best choice. You can transfer from the JR Line at Yamashina Station.

- Take the Tozai Subway Line and get off at "Higashiyama Station."
    - From the Yamashina area, take the train bound for "Uzumasa Tenjingawa."
    - From the Nijo or Karasuma area, take the train bound for "Rokujizo" or "Biwako-Hamaotsu."
- Exit from Exit 2, walk 80 meters to the left to the northbound "Higashiyama Sanjo" bus stop, located diagonally across the "Higashiyama Sanjo" intersection.
- Use one of the following buses, each operating approximately every 10 minutes:
    - City Bus Route 201 bound for "Hyakumanben/Senbon Imadegawa": Get off at "Kyodai Seimon-mae," then walk about 5 minutes.
    - City Bus Route 206 bound for "Takano/Kitaoji Bus Terminal": Get off at "Kyodai Seimon-mae," then walk about 10 minutes.

### 14th-15th: Access to ICC Kyoto

The Karasuma Subway Line provides convenient access.

- Take the Karasuma Subway Line bound for "Kokusaikaikan" and get off at "Kokusaikaikan Station."
- Exit from Exit 4-2 and walk about 5 minutes.

You can also access ICC Kyoto by bus (City Bus Routes 5, 31, 65, or Kyoto-Bus Routes Toku-16 and Toku-17), but service is infrequent and the coverage area is limited. Please check the schedules and routes carefully before using these options.

## Accommodation

There are limited accommodation options near Kyoto University and the Kyoto International Conference Center. We recommend staying in central Kyoto, especially along the **Karasuma Subway Line** or near **JR Kyoto Station**, for convenient access to both venues.

As Kyoto is a popular tourist destination, **we strongly recommend securing your accommodation as early as possible**. If you book at the last minute, only expensive options may remain available.
