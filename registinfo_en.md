## Restrictions on Multiple Presentations

The Ecological Society of Japan aims to create rules for participation that are easy for everyone to understand. At the 73rd conference, we have decided to revise the complicated rules of overlap restriction for presentations and to make <span style="color: red; ">“one-person, one-presentation”</span> as the general rule.

- Regardless of the presentation format—such as symposium, workshop, oral, or poster presentation—from this conference onward, **each participant is allowed to give only one presentation with abstract (\*)**.
    - Please note that, unlike previous conferences, <span style="color:red;">it is NOT permitted to be a presenter in both a workshop and a regular presentation at this conference</span>.
    - Presentations given in forums, which are events organized by various committees, are not subject to this restriction.
- **All presentations with abstracts (\*) must be given on-site**, except in cases of reasonable accommodation.
- In addition to the above presentations with abstract, it is possible to give contributions that do not require the submission of a presentation abstract (\*), such as general introductions, commentators, panelists, or lightning talks, or to organize a session only.
    - Please note that symposia and oral presentations may be scheduled in the same time slot. Even if presentation times overlap, <span style="color:red;">no adjustments will be made to the presentation schedule</span>. We kindly ask for your understanding that we will not be able to accommodate individual requests.
    - For workshops, considering their diverse formats, they are scheduled so as not to overlap with symposia and oral presentations.
- Each participant may organize only one session, except for forums. It is not permitted to register as an organizer for multiple sessions.

\* The basis for this restriction is the "presentation abstract" registered by each presenter. If the organizer of a session does not register as a "presentation" at the time of application and only provides information in the "session abstract," such presentations are not subject to the above restriction.

## Presentation Eligibility by Membership Type

Only ESJ members (regular, student and emeritus members) are eligible to be presenters (primary author) at the conference. Non-members are eligible to present in the following three cases:

- As an invited speaker in a symposium \([Symposium Invited Speaker Program](/regist_session_en#symposium-invited-speaker-program)\).
- Contributions in a symposium or workshop that does not require the submission of a presentation abstract, for example, general introductions, commentators, panelists, lightning talks, etc.
- High school students and younger presenting in the Junior Poster Session.

Co-presenters are not required to be members.

| **Presentation Type** | **Member \*1** | **Non-Member** |
|:---------------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|
| Regular Presentation (Oral or Poster) | ◯ | |
| Symposium/Workshop Organizer | ◯ | |
| Symposium Presenter | ◯ | ◯ \*2 |
| Workshop Presenter | ◯ | |
| Contributions in Symposium/Workshop<br/>without abstract submission \*3 | ◯ | ◯ |

\*1 Regular/Student members and emeritus members of the Ecological Society of Japan. Supporting members are not included.  
\*2 Limited to invited speakers.  
\*3 Limited to presentations that are not registered as "presentations" at the time of application by the session organizer.

## Procedure for new membership to the Ecological Society of Japan

Non-members who do not fall under any of the exceptions must **apply for membership in the Ecological Society of Japan prior to submitting registration and proposal**. The admission procedure may take some time, so please complete the procedure well in advance.

2. Upon confirmation of your application for membership, the Member Service Desk will notify you of your temporary membership number.
3. Please use your temporary membership number to register for the conference and presentation.

## Other Notes

### Notice on the Discontinuation of the English Presentation Award

The English Presentation Award was established with the aim of promoting the internationalization of society members, and it has provided many young researchers with opportunities to present in English as well as with encouragement. In line with this purpose, the award has achieved significant outcomes and has played an important role in supporting the international activities of our members. In recent years, the number of applicants has steadily increased, and many members have actively taken on presentations in English, leading us to conclude that the original objectives have been fully achieved. In light of these accomplishments, the award has fulfilled its role and will be concluded. However, English oral presentation sessions will continue to be held. At ESJ73, we plan to present a small gift to oral presenters in English, and we sincerely look forward to your continued active participation.

### If you have not paid the membership fee from 2024, you will not be able to complete any procedures

If you have not paid the membership fee from 2024, you will not be able to apply to speak at the conference until we can confirm payment of your 2024 membership fee. As you will not be able to submit your presentation until your payment is confirmed and your status is updated, please pay the membership fee, at least, one week before the deadline.

To check the status of your membership fee payment, please visit [My Page](https://iap-jp.org/esj/mypage/login/login).

### Abolition of Quota for Participation in Workshops Only

In the past, the ESJ conference has included a “Workshop Only Attendance” category in the registration process. However, taking into account the fact that the Workshop requires significant operating expenses and that only a few people have applied for this category in the past few years, the Board of Directors has decided to abolish the “Workshop Only Attendance” category for the ESJ72. We apologize for the inconvenience, but we ask that those who wish to attend only Workshops also follow the regular procedures to participate in the conference.

### Participation Certificates/Receipts

Participation certificates and receipts will be issued from the conference platform RakuRaku-Conference, not from the application site. Please note that printed copies will not be sent out and will be available for downloading after 6th Jan. 2026, when RakuRaku-Conference will be opened. Please note that the amount shown on the receipt is non-taxable for members (both regular and student) and taxable for non-members.　The participation fee covers the cost of attending the research presentations and meetings. Lunch and receptions are not included.

The Ecological Society of Japan is **not registered** as a Qualified Invoicing Business and cannot issue invoices.

If you wish to pay the registration fee publicly (e.g., by invoice payment), please apply for registration first. Next, please select “Postal Transfer” as the payment method, complete the application, and then contact us via the inquiry page. We ask that payment be made in advance.

### Abolition of Errata

The conference does not accept revisions based on errata after the presentation application or proposal has been submitted. Please make sure that there are no errors in the content when submitting your abstract. Students who have little experience in participating in academic meetings are especially encouraged to discuss the title and presenter information thoroughly with their academic advisors before submitting their abstracts.

### Cancellation Policy

If a cancellation request is received before the refund deadline for each event (17th Feb. 2026 for this year's event), a refund will be made, excluding bank transfer fees and other expenses. In principle, no refunds will be made after the refund deadline has passed.

### Handling of Research Achievements in the Event of Disasters

Speakers who have registered their abstracts and paid the registration fee by the deadline will have their presentation information and abstracts recognized as achievements by the society on the web page where the abstracts are published, even if they were unable to present their presentations due to the following reasons.

- Cancellation of the conference due to fire, earthquake, weather, man-made disasters, infectious diseases, etc.
- Failure of conference platform or major network faults

However, if the registration fee is not paid by the deadline, the presentation information and abstract will be removed from the web page where the abstracts are published, and the research concerned will not be recognized as an achievement, even if it is listed in the program.
