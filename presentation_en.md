# Guidelines for Presentations

Please note that only currently available information regarding the presentations is provided here. **More detailed information will to be updated around January**.

## Oral Presentation

- All presentations must use the PCs provided at the venue. Presentations using personal laptops are not permitted.
- **All Presenters must personally register their presentation files (e.g., PowerPoint) onto the presentation PC in advance.**
    - Please bring a USB flash drive and proceed to the Speaker Ready Room located within the venue.
    - Details will be updated around January.
- If you wish, you can use the [Self On-Demand Streaming](#Self-On-Demand-Streaming) to record your presentation in advance and stream it on the conference platform.

## Sessions

- For symposia, workshops, and forums, presentation PCs will not be prepared at the venue. **Presenters or organizers are required to bring their own PCs for presentations**.
    - HDMI is used for connecting to the projector. If you do not have an HDMI conversion adapter, please prepare one in advance.
- The conference organizing committee will not provide a Wi-Fi environment specifically for sessions. Session organizers are required to prepare their own Wi-Fi if needed. 
    - For details about the venue’s Wi-Fi environment, please refer to [**this page**](/about_en#Wi-Fi-connectivity).
- At most venues, the tables and chairs in the audience seating area are fixed to the floor. Please be aware of this when planning discussions etc.
- If the organizer requests it, the presentation will be recorded by a contractor.
    - To prevent troubles for recording, all recording tasks will be handled by the contractor. Organizers cannot perform the recording. The [Self On-Demand Streaming](#Self-On-Demand-Streaming) prepared for oral presentations is not available.
    - Recording will be conducted using cameras provided by the contractor installed at the venue, so the venue layout and speakers' faces will be visible during recording.
    - For Q&A and discussions, only content spoken through the microphone can be recorded.

## Self On-Demand Streaming

At this conference, all oral presenters could utilize “Self On-Demand Streaming,” where they record their own presentations and stream them on the conference platform.

- It covers all oral presentations.
    - The option to upload "explanatory videos", previously available for poster presentations, has been extended to oral presentations as well.
- The use of Self On-Demand Streaming is **optional**. It is not mandatory for presentations.
    - We do not permit online-only presentations. **If you cancel your on-site presentation, you will also be unable to use Self On-Demand Streaming**.
- You may only upload one video containing content equivalent to the presentation given on the day.
    - Format is MP4 only, with a maximum size of 500MB.
    - Please keep your presentation within the allotted time (oral presentation: 15 minutes) and do not exceed it significantly.
- **Recording presentation at the conference venue is strictly prohibited in any form**. Please record individually either before or after the conference.
- Uploading and streaming will be conducted on the conference platform “RakuRaku-Conference”.
    - Uploads can be made at any time after 30th Jan. 2026 on the RakuRaku-Conference. There is no deadline for uploads, and replacements can be made at any time.
    - Only conference participants can view the streaming. It will be published with settings that prevent downloading.
    - To make it clear at a glance whether streaming video is available, a marker will be added to the title when a video is uploaded on the conference platform.
- Presenters shall bear full responsibility for any consequences arising from the content of their videos.
    - Online video streaming constitutes public transmission under copyright law. Please take care to avoid copyright violations and defamation issues.
    - When citing published works, always clearly indicate the source. If your presentation includes works owned by others, you must obtain permission from the copyright holder for streaming.
