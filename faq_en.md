# Frequently Asked Questions

## Deadline and conference program

### Can you extend the deadline? The deadline has passed for: applying for membership to conduct a session or presentation; applying for a session or a presentation; submitting an abstract.

We cannot extend the deadlines for any reason.

### Can you schedule my presentation/session slot to fit the days when I am available? I can only participate in the conference on some of the days.

We cannot accept any requests to change the conference program.

### Can you arrange our presentations to be sequential? My colleagues and I plan to have several oral presentations on related research topics.

We cannot accept any requests to change the conference program. For more details about why we are so rigid, please refer to the following: *[Why are we so inflexible? â€“ Reasons for requesting strict compliance with the deadlines and regulations](https://esj.ne.jp/meeting/info/why_so_inflexible_e.html)*

## Qualifications for entry and registration fee

### Can non-members participate or give a presentation?

Upon paying the registration fee, non-members can join the audience. Non-members can be co-authors of presentations. 

About the presentation, except for invited speakers to the Symposia or the Forum, non-members cannot be either organizers or speakers. Please confirm the qualifications for entry for other roles (e.g., presenter or organizer) in the [Eligibility for Registration](/registinfo_en#presentation-eligibility-by-membership-type).

### Are the workshop presenters required to apply for entry and pay the registration fee?

Because the workshops are formalized events, presenters who only attend the workshops are also required to apply for entry and pay the registration fee. Please check the [registration for participation](registinfo_en_en#
#Registration-for-participation).

### Are audience members who only attend the workshops required to apply for entry and pay the registration fee?

Participants who attend only the workshops are also required to register for the conference and pay the registration fee. Since in ESJ73 online contents seems to be extremely limited, [the workshop-only-participation fee is no longer offered](/registinfo_en#abolition-of-quota-for-participation-in-workshops-only). We apologize for the inconvenience, but we kindly ask you to participate in the convention as a regular participant.

### Can non-members attend the public lectures?

Yes. Participants who attend only the public lectures do not have to apply for entry and paying a registration fee is not required.

### Can the registration and banquet fees be paid by my organization using public expense?

Yes. If you wish to pay by invoice, please apply for participation at the registration system first. Please select "Postal Transfer" as the payment method. We request that you pay in advance. After completing the application, please contact us from the [inquiry form](contact_en).

### Will receipts for the registration fee be issued?

Yes. Receipts will be issued from RakuRaku Conference (ex- ONLINE CONF), not from the registration system. They will be available after 6th January, when RakuRaku Conference will be open.

### Is the registration fee taxable?

The registration fee for the members (both regular participants and students) is not taxable, and the registration fee for the non-members is taxable and includes tax.

### What expenses are included in the participation fee?

The participation fee only covers the cost of attending the research presentations and meetings. Lunch and receptions are not included.

### If I'm not planning to give a presentation, can I apply to attend the meeting after the application deadline for the presentation registration has passed?

Yes. You can apply and pay for the meeting as an audience member until the starting day of the ESJ73 meeting.

### I'd like to change the information I submitted about my oral/poster presentation

You can freely cancel or change your submitted information on the webpage before the deadline for the presentation registration (October 31, 2025). After that, you cannot correct any information about your presentation.

### I want to cancel my presentation. How should I do this?

You can freely cancel your presentation on the webpage before the deadline for registration (October 31, 2025). After the deadline, please contact us from the [inquiry form](contact_en) (in that case, **please be sure to include the presentation number that are subject to cancellation**).

### I want to cancel my registration to the ESJ72. How should I do this?

Please contact us from the [inquiry form](contact_en). You can cancel your registration free of charge until 21st Feb. 2025.

### I would like to give a presentation at the symposium. Can I also apply for the oral or poster presentation to have a presentation in case my proposal for the symposium is not accepted?

Please don't apply for symposium and oral/poster presentation together. In case your proposal is not accepted, alternative measures such as transferring for the workshop or oral/poster presentation will be provided.

## Abstracts

### Will abstracts be peer-reviewed?

Abstracts will not be peer-reviewed. Abstracts will be published as they are registered in the application system.

### I was not able to register my abstract by the deadline. Will my presentation be canceled?

No, you can give your presentation even if you miss the abstract submission deadline. However, your abstract will be left blank.

## Mailing program booklet

### I registered in advance but have not received the program booklet

Program booklet will not be produced for ESJ73. Please obtain the necessary information from the ESJ73 official website, the ESJ abstract website, or the conference platform (RakuRaku Conference).

### Do forum speakers need to register their abstracts?

No, it is not necessary. For the forum, the organizer will register the abstract.

## Self-on-demand

### Can I stream my presentation including the contents that cannot be contained in the oral presentation on-site due to time constraints by self-on-demand?

The content and time of video should be equivalent to presentation at the venue. Significant differences from the presentation at the venue would be contrary to the purpose of self-on-demand streaming.

### Can oral presentations be recorded on-site and streamed self-on-demand?

No. This is because the PCs used for oral presentations at the venue cannot be used to record presentations or extract data afterwards. In addition, bringing your own equipment (video cameras, tripods, etc.) to the venue for recording is not permitted, as it may interfere with the smooth transition between presentations.

### I canceled my oral presentation, but I recorded it in advance. Is it acceptable to stream it by self-on-demand?

No. This ie because cancelled presentations will be deleted from the conference platform.

### My presentation is scheduled for a symposium (or workshop). Can I record my presentation in advance and stream it by self-on-demand?

No. All symposia and workshops (previously requested) at this conference will be recorded at the venue by a contractor and streamed on-demand later. Therefore, self-on-demand by organizers and speakers is not possible.
