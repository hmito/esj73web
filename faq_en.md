# Frequently Asked Questions

## Qualifications for Entry

### Can non-members attend as audience?

Non-members can attend as audience by paying the conference registration fee.

### Can non-members give a presentation?

Except for invited speakers in symposia or forums, non-members cannot register abstracts or organize sessions. For details, please refer to [Eligibility for Registration by Membership Type](/registinfo_en#Presentation-Eligibility-by-Membership-Type).

### I want to invite non-members to my session. What should I do?

For symposia, non-members can participate for free as invited speakers using the invited speaker system. However, the same non-member cannot be invited for two consecutive years.

Forums also have an invited speaker system. Invited speakers for forums can participate in that forum for free, but must pay the registration fee if participating in other sessions or events.

For workshops, non-members cannot register abstracts or give presentations. Please join the Ecological Society of Japan and apply as a regular member.

No printed conference program booklet will be produced for this event. Please obtain necessary information from the conference website, the abstracts website, and the conference platform (RakuRaku-Conference).

## Abstracts

### Will abstracts be peer-reviewed?

### Do forum speakers need to register their abstracts?

No, it is not necessary. For the forum, the organizer will register the abstract.

## Self On-Demand Streaming

### Can I stream my presentation including the contents that cannot be contained at on-site due to time constraints by Self On-Demand Streaming?

The content and time of video should be equivalent to presentation at on-site. Significant differences from the presentation at on-site would be contrary to the purpose of Self On-Demand Streaming.

### Can my oral presentation be recorded on-site and streamed in Self On-Demand Streaming?

No. This is because the PCs used for oral presentations at the venue cannot record presentations or extract data afterwards. In addition, bringing your own equipment (video cameras, tripods, etc.) to the venue for recording is not permitted, as it interfere with the smooth transition between presentations.

### I canceled my oral presentation, but recorded it in advance. Is it acceptable to stream the recorded presentation by Self On-Demand Streaming?

No. This ie because cancelled presentations will be deleted from the conference platform.

### My presentation is scheduled for a symposium (or workshop). Can I record my presentation in advance and stream it by Self On-Demand Streaming?

No. All symposia and workshops (requested on-demand streaming in advance) at this conference will be recorded at the venue by a contractor and streamed later. Therefore, Self On-Demand Streaming by organizers and speakers is not possible.
