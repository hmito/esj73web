# Mentoring & Meetup (Moai)

We will be holding "Mentoring & Meetup (Moai)," an event for early-career researchers to consult with senior researchers who have pursued careers in ecology-related fields about their careers and research. Why not take this opportunity through Moai to network with senior researchers, transcending the boundaries of your affiliated institution and field of study?

## About Moai

This year, we have planned both "Online Moai \(個別モアイ\)", where mentees can have one-on-one online consultations with a mentor, and "Face-to-Face Moai \(対面モアイ\)" an on-site, face-to-face networking event.

- **Online Moai**: We will arrange a one-on-one online exchange session between a mentee and a mentor (approx. 30 minutes to 1 hour) during or around the period of the ESJ73.

- **Face-to-Face Moai**: This will be held as part of the Forum session during the ESJ annual meeting. We will set up booths for different topics such as career and research, providing a venue for small-group exchange, consultation, and networking (around 5 to 6 people per group).

Any member of the Ecological Society of Japan can easily participate in Moai, regardless of whether they are attending the annual meeting.

Details on how to apply or the schedule will be posted on the Moai website (scheduled for release in January 2026). Please check the Moai website for further information.
