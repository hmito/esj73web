- At all sessions, [speakers will be asked to present on-site](#online-support).
- We look forward to receiving enthusiastic proposals from researchers from various positions, genders, and nationalities.

### Symposium

Symposium is the main session of the conference, and we call members to submit proposals for organizing. Conference participants look forward to symposia with fresh themes that have never been presented before.

- Duration of the session is 180 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.
- In principle, all presentations will be recorded and made available on-demand to conference participants during the meeting or for about a month after the conference.
- To promote international information dissemination and discussion at the symposium, we welcome the active participation of international researchers and non-members through the Invited Speaker System.
- To promote exchange with other disciplines, non-members of the Ecological Society of Japan are welcome to give invited lectures. The conference registration fee for invited speakers will be waived. **Please note that the same non-member cannot be the invited speaker for two consecutive years**.

### Workshop

Workshop is the session traditionally emphasized by the Ecological Society of Japan as a place to help launch new fields and to allow free discussion of various topics outside the framework of ecology.

- Duration of the session is 90 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.
- If requested, the presentations will be recorded and streamed on-demand to conference participants during the congress or for about a month after the congress. However, in the case of a large number of requests for streaming, on-demand streaming may be selected in principle on a first-come, first-served basis.
- It is also possible to hold the session without abstract submissions, such as statement of opinions or lightning talks. In this case, there is no need to register for abstract submissions.

### Forum

Forum is organized by the committees of the Ecological Society of Japan to solicit the opinions of a wide range of members on issues related to the management of the Ecological Society of Japan and ecology that the Society is working on, to promote information sharing among members, and to build consensus within the Society through wide-ranging discussions.

- Duration of the session is 90 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.
- If requested, the presentations will be recorded and streamed on-demand to conference participants during the congress or for about a month after the congress. However, in the case of a large number of requests for streaming, on-demand streaming may be selected in principle on a first-come, first-served basis.

## Online Support

### Online Presentations

**Online presentations will not be accepted for presentation with abstract submission at this conference**. This is to avoid problems in advance because there are limitations on wifi network at the conference venue. We appreciate your understanding.

If it is difficult to make a presentation onsite, **remote presentations using Zoom will be only accepted** for presentations that do not require abstract submission (e.g., explanation of purpose, comments, and statements of opinion in the session) and for forum presentations only. However, the connection to Zoom is strictly limited to organizer and presenter. Additionally, the conference organizing committee will not provide a Wi-Fi environment solely for the purpose of remote presentations. Please prepare the Wi-Fi environment at the organizer's responsibility.

### Streaming of Presentations

All symposia and a part of workshops and forums will be recorded and made available on RakuRaku-Conference at a later date.

In order to prevent problems with the recordings, all recording work will be handled by a contractor. Recording will only be done on the cameras set up by the contractor at the venue, so the venue's surroundings, speaker's face and audio will be recording. For the Q&A session and discussions, only speeches made through the microphone can be recorded.

## Organization of Symposium and Workshop

### How to organize Sessions

- **Presentations must be made using the PCs brought in by organizers or speakers**. [the PCs set up at the venue](presentation_en#notice) are not allowed to be used.
- For all sessions, the organizers and speakers must be members of the Ecological Society of Japan. However, non-members may be invited to give invited lectures for symposia only ([see eligibility for each membership category](registinfo_en#presentation-eligibility-by-membership-type)).
- The organizer/speaker of a Symposium/Workshop cannot be an organizer/speaker of another session or a speaker of Regular Presentations. In this conference, the combination of Workshop and Regular presentation also cannot be duplicated (see [Overlap restrictions](registinfo_en#overlap-restrictions)).
- Explanation of aim, comments, and statements of opinion that do not involve abstract registration do not count as presentations. Therefore, non-members may participate in the conference in these forms and are not subject to duplication restrictions.
    - **Please note that even if you are only making comments or statement of opinions without submitting an abstract, you are still required to register for the conference. Organizers, please be alert them**.
- If you apply to Symposium, it should consist of at least two speakers. If there is only one speaker, please apply to Workshop.
- From the viewpoint of respecting diversity, organizers are requested to structure the sessions with consideration for the balance of positions and genders of organizers and speakers.
- In addition to the overall explanation of aims and summary, abstracts of individual presentations will be posted on the conference web page and on the conference platform.
- In view of the increasing number of international students and participants from overseas, we encourage Symposia to be held in English. Even if the meeting is held in Japanese, please make efforts to the extent possible by preparing a simple handout in English.
