### Symposium

Symposium is the main session of the conference, and we call members to submit proposals for organizing. Conference participants look forward to symposia with fresh themes that have never been presented before.

- Duration of the session is 180 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.
- To promote exchange with other disciplines, non-members of the Ecological Society of Japan are welcome to give invited lectures. The conference registration fee for invited speakers will be waived. **Please note that the same non-member cannot be the invited speaker for two consecutive years**. Please see [**here**](#symposium-invited-speaker-program) for procedures for invited lectures.
- To promote international information dissemination and discussion at the symposium, we welcome the active participation of international researchers and non-members through the Invited Speaker System.

### Workshop

Workshop is the session traditionally emphasized by the Ecological Society of Japan as a place to help launch new fields and to allow free discussion of various topics outside the framework of ecology.

- Duration of the session is 90 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.
- It is also possible to hold the session without abstract submissions, such as statement of opinions or lightning talks. In this case, there is no need to register for abstract submissions.

### Forum

Forum is organized by the committees of the Ecological Society of Japan to solicit the opinions of a wide range of members on issues related to the management of the Ecological Society of Japan and ecology that the Society is working on, to promote information sharing among members, and to build consensus within the Society through wide-ranging discussions.

- Duration of the session is 90 minutes. Speakers are required to present on-site.

## Online Support

### Online Presentations

**Online presentations will not be accepted for presentations with abstract submission at this conference.**

If it is difficult to present on-site, **remote presentations using Zoom will be permitted only for presentations that do not require abstract submission**, such as explanation of purpose, comments, or statements of opinion. These presentations can also be recorded and included in the on-demand streaming described below. **However, connection to Zoom is strictly limited to organizers and presenters.**

The conference organizing committee will not provide a Wi-Fi environment specifically for sessions. Session organizers are required to prepare their own Wi-Fi if needed. For details about the venue’s Wi-Fi environment, please refer to [**this page**](/about_en#wi-fi-connectivity).

### On-Demand Streaming of Presentations

All sessions at this conference—including symposia, workshops, and forums—will be recorded and made available later on the RakuRaku-Conference at a later date.

In order to prevent problems with the recordings, all recording works will be handled by a contractor. Recording will only be done on the cameras set up by the contractor at the venue, so the venue's surroundings, speaker's face and audio will be recorded. For the Q&A session and discussions, only speeches made through the microphone can be recorded.

## Organization of Symposium and Workshop

### How to organize Sessions

- For all sessions, the organizers and speakers must be members of the Ecological Society of Japan. However, non-members may be invited to give invited lectures for symposia only ([see eligibility for each membership category](/registinfo_en#presentation-eligibility-by-membership-type)).
    - For information on how to use the symposium invited speaker program, please refer to [**here**](#symposium-invited-speaker-program).
- From ESJ73, [**each participant is allowed to give only one presentation with abstract\(\*\)**](/registinfo_en#restrictions-on-multiple-presentations). Unlike previous conferences, **it is no longer permitted to be a presenter in both a Workshop and a Regular Presentation**.
- Presentations such as explanation of purpose, commentator, panelist, or lightning talk, which do not require abstract submission \(\*\), are not counted as presentations. Therefore, participation in sessions in these formats is possible even for non-members and is not subject to the restriction on multiple presentations.
    - However, **even for presentations without abstract submission, conference registration is required. Organizers are requested to inform participants accordingly**.
    - Symposia and Regular Presentations may be scheduled in the same time slot. If a presentation without abstract submission overlaps with your own presentation time, **no adjustment of presentation slots will be made**.
    - As Workshops may take various formats, they are planned to be scheduled in time slots that do not overlap with Symposia or Regular Presentations.
- If you apply to Symposium, it should consist of at least two speakers. If there is only one speaker, please apply to Workshop.
- Organizers are requested to structure the sessions with consideration for the balance of positions and genders of organizers and speakers, in accordance with the [promotion of diversity at the conference](/about_en#promoting-diversity-at-the-meeting).
- In addition to the overall explanation of aims and summary, abstracts of individual presentations will be posted on the conference web page and on the conference platform.
- In view of the increasing number of international students and participants from overseas, we encourage Symposia to be held in English. Even if the meeting is held in Japanese, please make efforts to the extent possible by preparing a simple handout in English.

\* The basis for this restriction is the "presentation abstract" registered by each presenter. If the organizer of a session does not register as a "presentation" at the time of application and only provides information in the "session abstract," such presentations are not subject to the above restriction.
